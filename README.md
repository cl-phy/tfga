Have fun with genetic algorithms (and the like) under TensorFlow.

## Motivation

* Have fun, and learn both genetic algorithms and TensorFlow.
* TensorFlow employs the GPU, which is much faster in manipulating tensor-like objects than CPU.
* We'd take advantage of the higher-order function of TensorFlow, e.g. `tf.map_fn`, which implements parallelism implicitly.
